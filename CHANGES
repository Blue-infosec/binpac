  * Distribution cleanup. (Jon Siwek and Robin Sommer)

  * Arrays now suport the &transient attribute.

    If set, parsed elements won't actually be added to the array, and
    read access to the array aren't permitted. This is helpful to save
    memory in the case of large arrays for which elements don't need
    (or can't) be buffered. (Robin Sommer)

  * Install binaries with an RPATH. (Jon Siwek)

  * Workaround for FreeBSD CMake port missing debug flags. (Jon Siwek)

    Found by Emmanuele Zambon.

  * A command line -q flag to quiet the output, plus a fix for a small
    compiler warning. (Seth Hall)

  * Initial import of Bro's binpac subdirectory from SVN r7088. (Jon Siwek)
