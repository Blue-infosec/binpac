Prerequisites
=============

BinPAC relies on the following libraries and tools, which need to be installed
before you begin with the installation:

    * Flex
       Flex is already installed on most systems, so with luck you can
       skip having to install it yourself.

    * Bison
       Bison is also already installed on many system.

    * CMake 2.8 or greater
       CMake is a cross-platform, open-source build system, typically
       not installed by default.  See http://www.cmake.org for more
       information regarding CMake and the installation steps below for
       how to use it to build this distribution.

Installation
============

To build and install into /usr/local/binpac:

    > ./configure
    > cd build
    > make
    > make install

This will perform an out-of-source build into the build directory using the
default build options and then install binaries into /usr/local/binpac/bin

You can specify a different installation directory with

   > ./configure --prefix=<dir>.

Run "./configure --help" for more options.
